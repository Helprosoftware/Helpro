Hello
This is all of the code for the hprweb 
it is programmed in Django, backend in python, frontend in html and a bit of css
-the members files holds the necesary code for the maths section
-the biology file holds the necesary code for the "source code" section of the website
-the physics and chemistry files hold the necesary code for those sections :)
the important files, if you want the code for calculating and all of the code which does the actual "work" (calculate empirical formulae, gauss probability matrixes...), are the various --views.py-- files
the rest of the files are used for making all of this a website
the templates folders contain the html (frontend), if you're interested in that (for some reason)
take into account some files are under the gpl v3 licence, these include: All the views.py and more
